To ensure that all three method calls execute without error, you need to declare the `tryMe` method in the `ClassTest3` class with the appropriate parameter type. In this case, the `tryMe` method should take an argument of the type that is common to all three classes (`X`, `Y`, and `Z`), which is `C` because they all implement the `C` interface.

Here is the method header for the `tryMe` method:

```java
public int tryMe(C obj) {
    // Method implementation here
}
```

With this method header, you can call `tryMe` with objects of type `X`, `Y`, and `Z` without any errors, as they all implement the `C` interface.
