To serialize the objects of the `Teacher` class but not the `rank` field, you can use the `transient` keyword for the `rank` field. Here's the modified `Teacher` class in Markdown format:

```java
package ct5.secB;
import java.io.Serializable;

public class Teacher implements Serializable {
    String name, designation;
    transient int rank;

    public Teacher(String name, String designation, int rank) {
        this.name = name;
        this.designation = designation;
        this.rank = rank;
    }
}
```

In the code above:

1. We import the `Serializable` interface, which is necessary for object serialization.

2. We mark the `rank` field with the `transient` keyword, which tells the Java serialization mechanism to exclude this field from the serialization process.

By making these changes, you can serialize objects of the `Teacher` class without including the `rank` field in the serialized output.
