To exclude the `rank` attribute from serialization in the `Player` class, you can use the `transient` keyword. Here's the modified `Player` class in Markdown format:

```java
public class Player {
    String name, game;
    transient int rank;

    public Player(String name, String game, int rank) {
        this.name = name;
        this.game = game;
        this.rank = rank;
    }
}
```

By marking the `rank` attribute as `transient`, you are telling Java's serialization mechanism not to serialize this field when objects of the `Player` class are serialized. This means that when you serialize a `Player` object, the `rank` field won't be included in the serialized representation.
