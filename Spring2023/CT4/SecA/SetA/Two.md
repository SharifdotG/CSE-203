The code you provided contains some syntax errors. In Java, the `try` block must be immediately followed by a `catch` block, and `catch` blocks should be inside the `try` block. The `finally` block should also be outside the `try` block. Additionally, in your code, you are trying to catch two different exceptions (NumberFormatException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) in the same `catch` block, which is not allowed.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
package ct4.secA;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside Try.");
            int i = Integer.parseInt("X");
            System.out.println(i);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 1.");
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 2.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside Finally");
        }
        System.out.println("End.");
    }
}
```

Now, let's analyze the code's behavior:

1. The program starts executing in the `main` method.
2. It enters the `try` block and prints "Inside Try."
3. Inside the `try` block, there is an attempt to parse the string "X" to an integer using `Integer.parseInt("X")`. Since "X" is not a valid integer representation, it will throw a `NumberFormatException`.
4. The `catch (NumberFormatException e)` block is executed, printing "Inside Catch 1."
5. The `finally` block is executed, printing "Inside Finally."
6. The program proceeds to execute the statement outside of the `try-catch-finally` block, which is `System.out.println("End.")`.

The output of the corrected code will be:

```
Inside Try.
Inside Catch 1.
Inside Finally
End.
```

So, the program will print "Inside Try," "Inside Catch 1," "Inside Finally," and "End."
