# The Provided Code

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside Try.");
            int i = Integer.parseInt("X");
            System.out.println(i);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 1.");
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 2.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside Finally");
        }
        System.out.println("End.");
    }
}
```

The code you've provided demonstrates the use of try-catch-finally blocks in Java.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Inside the `try` block:
   - It prints "Inside Try."
   - It attempts to convert the string "X" to an integer using `Integer.parseInt("X")`. This line will throw a `NumberFormatException` because "X" is not a valid integer representation.

2. Since a `NumberFormatException` is thrown, the control flow moves to the `catch` block that matches this exception type:
   - It prints "Inside Catch 1."

3. Regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, the `finally` block always gets executed:
   - It prints "Inside Finally".

4. After the `finally` block, the code continues to execute:
   - It prints "End."

Therefore, the output of this code will be:

```plaintext
Inside Try.
Inside Catch 1.
Inside Finally
End.
```

Explanation:

- "Inside Try." is printed because it's the first line within the try block.
- "Inside Catch 1." is printed because a `NumberFormatException` is caught by the corresponding catch block.
- "Inside Finally" is printed as the `finally` block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
- "End." is printed because it's the last line in the `main` method and executes after the `finally` block.
