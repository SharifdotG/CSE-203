```java
package ct4.secA;

public class TestException {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside Try.");
            int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
            int i = a[4];
            System.out.println("Output: " + i);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 1.");
        } catch (NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 2.");
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 3.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside Finally");
        }

        System.out.println("Done.");
    }
}
```

Now, let's analyze the code and its expected output:

1. The code enters the `try` block.
2. Inside the `try` block, it prints "Inside Try."
3. It attempts to access an element at index 4 in the array `a`, which is out of bounds because the array has a length of 4 (indexes 0 to 3). This will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
4. Since there's a `catch` block for `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, it will catch the exception and execute "Inside Catch 3."
5. The `finally` block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred. It prints "Inside Finally."
6. The program continues after the `finally` block and prints "Done."

So, the expected output of this code will be:

```
Inside Try.
Inside Catch 3.
Inside Finally
Done.
```

In summary, this code will catch the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` and execute the appropriate `catch` block, and then it will proceed to the `finally` block and continue with the program.
