In Java, exceptions can be of two types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. The key difference between the two is that checked exceptions are required to be either caught (using a `try-catch` block) or declared in the method's signature using the `throws` keyword, while unchecked exceptions (also known as runtime exceptions) are not subject to this requirement. The compiler enforces these rules.

In your code, `NullPointerException` is an unchecked exception, while `IOException` is a checked exception.

Here's why you're not seeing a compiler error in the `test` method but seeing one in the `test1` method:

1. In the `test` method, you are throwing a `NullPointerException`, which is an unchecked exception. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared in the method's signature or caught explicitly. They can propagate up the call stack without any issue.

2. In the `test1` method, you are throwing an `IOException`, which is a checked exception. The Java compiler enforces the rule that checked exceptions must be either caught or declared in the method's signature. Since you are not catching the `IOException` and not declaring it with a `throws` clause, the compiler reports an error.

To fix the error in the `test1` method, you can either add a `throws` declaration to the method signature or catch the `IOException` using a `try-catch` block. Here's how you can do that:

```java
public void test1() throws IOException {
    throw new IOException("");
}
```

Or:

```java
public void test1() {
    try {
        throw new IOException("");
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // Handle the exception or log it.
    }
}
```

In summary, you're seeing a compiler error in `test1` because `IOException` is a checked exception, and you're not handling or declaring it. There is no error in the `test` method because `NullPointerException` is an unchecked exception, and Java does not require you to handle or declare unchecked exceptions.
