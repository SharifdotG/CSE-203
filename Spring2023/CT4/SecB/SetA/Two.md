The provided Java code has several issues, and it will not compile successfully. There are syntax errors and logical problems. Let's go through the issues step by step:

1. The `catch` and `finally` blocks should be properly nested within the `try` block, but in your code, they are not correctly structured.

2. The `catch` block should specify the exception type it is supposed to catch. In your code, you have two `catch` blocks without specifying the exception types.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside Try.");
            int i = Integer.parseInt("X");
            System.out.println(i);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 1.");
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Inside Catch 2.");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Inside Finally");
        }

        System.out.println("End.");
    }
}
```

With these corrections, let's discuss the output:

1. The code enters the `try` block and prints "Inside Try."

2. It attempts to parse the string "X" as an integer, which will throw a `NumberFormatException` since "X" is not a valid integer.

3. The program catches the `NumberFormatException` in the first `catch` block and prints "Inside Catch 1."

4. Since there are no further exceptions and the `finally` block is always executed, it prints "Inside Finally."

5. Finally, the program proceeds to execute the code outside the `try-catch-finally` structure and prints "End."

So, the output of the corrected code will be:

```
Inside Try.
Inside Catch 1.
Inside Finally
End.
```

The code prints the statements in the order they appear in the code.
