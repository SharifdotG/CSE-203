The given Java code creates a new thread inside the `main` method, overrides its `run` method to print the thread name and a loop counter, and then calls the `run` method directly. When `run` is called directly, it behaves like a normal method call and does not create a new thread of execution. Here's the detailed step-by-step output:

```java
public class ThreadTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread("My Thread") {
            public void run() {
                for(int i = 1; i < 5; i++) { // i = 1, 2, 3, 4
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+":"+i);
                }
            }
        };
        
        t.run();
    }
}
```

1. A new thread object `t` is created with the name "My Thread".
2. The `run` method of the thread is overridden to print the current thread's name and loop counter `i` from 1 to 4.
3. The `run` method is called directly using `t.run()`, which does not start a new thread but executes the `run` method in the current thread of execution.

Output:

```plaintext
main:1
main:2
main:3
main:4
```

Explanation:

- The `run` method is executed in the main thread of the program, so the thread's name is "main".
- The loop runs from 1 to 4, and at each iteration, it prints the thread name followed by the loop counter value.
