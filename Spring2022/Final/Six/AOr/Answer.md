To sort the list of Devices by price, you need to implement the `Comparable` interface in the `Device` class and override the `compareTo` method to specify how the objects should be compared for sorting. Here are the changes you need to make to the `Device` class to fix the error and enable sorting:

```java
public class Device implements Comparable<Device> {
    String name, category;
    int price;

    public Device(String name, String category, int price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.category = category;
        this.price = price;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.printf("%s:%s:%d\n", name, category, price);
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Device otherDevice) {
        return Integer.compare(this.price, otherDevice.price);
    }
}
```

With these changes, the `Device` class now implements the `Comparable` interface and provides a custom comparison method using the `compareTo` method. This method compares two `Device` objects based on their `price` field, which allows you to sort the list of `Device` objects by price using `Collections.sort(myDevices);` in your `MyCollection` class.
