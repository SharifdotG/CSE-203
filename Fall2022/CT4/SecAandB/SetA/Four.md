The code you provided will not compile successfully due to a couple of issues. Let's analyze the problems and then fix them:

1. In the `TestClass.java` file, you're attempting to access the `quesCount` variable, which is not a member of the `CT` class. It's defined within an anonymous inner class created when you instantiate the `CT` class. Therefore, you cannot access it directly from the `ct4` object.

2. The `score` field in the `CT` class is not initialized, and you are trying to increment it without initializing it. This will result in a NullPointerException when you try to call `giveMark` on the `ct4` object.

To fix the code, you can initialize the `score` field in the `CT` class, and to access the `quesCount` variable, you should create a getter method for it in the anonymous inner class. Here's the corrected code:

```java
package ct4;

public class CT {
    String name;
    int score;

    public CT(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = 0; // Initialize the score field
    }

    public void giveMark(int mark) {
        score += mark;
    }

    public int getMark() {
        return score;
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println(name + ":" + score);
    }
}

package ct4;

public class TestClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CT ct4 = new CT("CT4") {
            int quesCount = 0;

            @Override
            public void giveMark(int mark) {
                quesCount++;
                super.giveMark(mark); // Call the parent class method
            }

            public int getQuesCount() {
                return quesCount;
            }

            @Override
            public void display() {
                super.display();
                System.out.println(":" + getQuesCount());
            }
        };

        ct4.giveMark(5);
        ct4.giveMark(5);
        ct4.display();
    }
}
```

In this fixed code, we initialize the `score` field in the constructor of the `CT` class, and we call the parent class's `giveMark` method using `super.giveMark(mark)` in the overridden method of the anonymous inner class. We also added a `getQuesCount` method to access the `quesCount` variable from outside the anonymous inner class. Finally, we call the `display` method to print the name, score, and question count.

With these changes, the code will compile successfully, and the output will be:

```
CT4:10:2
```

This output indicates that the score is 10, and there were 2 questions counted.
