The provided code has two issues:

1. **Compilation Error**: The `start()` method can only be called on objects of type `Thread`. In the `TestThread.java` file, you are trying to call `start()` method on objects of `MyThread` class which does not have a `start()` method. To fix this, you need to create `Thread` objects using `MyThread` instances.

2. **Concurrency Issue**: Although not a compilation error, there is a concurrency issue in the code. Since both threads (`t1` and `t2`) share the same `MyThread` instance, there could be interleaving of the output. To ensure that the threads don't interfere with each other's output, you should create separate instances of `MyThread` for each thread.

Here's the corrected code:

**MyThread.java**:
```java
package ct5;

public class MyThread implements Runnable {

    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + ":" + i);
        }
    }
}
```

**TestThread.java**:
```java
package ct5;

public class TestThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread myThread1 = new MyThread(); // Create a new instance of MyThread
        MyThread myThread2 = new MyThread(); // Create another instance of MyThread
        
        Thread t1 = new Thread(myThread1); // Wrap the first instance in a Thread
        Thread t2 = new Thread(myThread2); // Wrap the second instance in a Thread
        
        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `MyThread` implements the `Runnable` interface, and in the `TestThread` class, two separate instances of `MyThread` are created. Each instance is wrapped in a `Thread` object, and then the `start()` method is called on these `Thread` objects. This ensures that each thread has its own instance of `MyThread` and avoids concurrency issues.
