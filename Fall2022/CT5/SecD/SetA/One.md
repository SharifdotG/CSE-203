There are a few issues in the code provided. I will point out the errors and provide the corrected version below:

1. **Semicolon Missing:**
   In the `main` method, a semicolon is missing after the declaration of the `tiger` object.

   **Correction:**
   ```java
   Animal tiger = new Animal("Tiger") {
       // ...
   };
   ```

2. **Access to `name` Variable:**
   In the `hunt` method, you are trying to access the `name` variable of the `Animal` class. However, the `name` variable is not visible in the anonymous class. You need to make the `name` variable `protected` in the `Animal` class to access it in the subclass.

   **Correction:**
   ```java
   protected String name, color;
   ```

3. **Initialization of `canSwim`:**
   In the `tiger` object declaration, you are trying to access the `canSwim` variable, which is not a member of the `Animal` class. If you want to access `canSwim`, you need to create a method in the anonymous class or declare `canSwim` in the `Animal` class.

   **Correction (Option 1 - Access through Method):**
   ```java
   public boolean canSwim() {
       return true;
   }
   ```
   
   **Correction (Option 2 - Declare in Animal class):**
   ```java
   protected boolean canSwim;
   ```

4. **Printing Animal Information:**
   In the `main` method, you are trying to print the `canSwim` variable, but it's not directly accessible. If you choose Option 2 for correction 3, you can access `canSwim` through a getter method in the `Animal` class.

   **Correction (Option 2 - Getter Method):**
   ```java
   public boolean canSwim() {
       return canSwim;
   }
   ```
   
Here's the corrected code:

```java
package ct5.secD;

public class TestAnimal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal tiger = new Animal("Tiger") {
            boolean canSwim = true;

            @Override
            public void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Roar");
            }

            public void hunt(String prey) {
                System.out.printf("%s like to hunt %s\n", name, prey);
            }
        };

        tiger.makeSound();
        tiger.hunt("Deer");
        System.out.println(tiger.canSwim());
    }
}

abstract class Animal{
    protected String name, color;
    float weight;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%s-%s-%.1f", name, color, weight);
    }
    
    public boolean canSwim() {
        return false;
    }
}
```

In this corrected version, I made the `name` variable `protected`, provided access to `canSwim` through a getter method, and added the missing semicolon after the `tiger` object declaration.
