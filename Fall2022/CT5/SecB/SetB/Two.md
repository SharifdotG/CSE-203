In the provided Java code, there are two threads, `t1` and `t2`, but they are not running in parallel. Instead, they are running sequentially within the `main` method of the `TestThread` class. This is because you are invoking the `run` method of each thread directly, which is just a regular method call and does not start a new thread of execution.

To run the threads in parallel, you should use the `start` method instead of the `run` method. Here's the modified code:

```java
public class TestThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.setName("First Thread");
        Thread t2 = new MyThread();
        t2.setName("2nd Thread");
        t1.start(); // Start the first thread
        t2.start(); // Start the second thread
    }
}
```

With this modification, two threads (`t1` and `t2`) will run in parallel, and you will see interleaved output from both threads.
