There are several errors in the given Java code. I'll identify and fix them:

1. In the `main` method, you're attempting to call `tiger.makeSound()`, but the `makeSound` method in the `Animal` class takes a `String` parameter. You need to pass a `String` argument to this method.

2. Similarly, in the `main` method, you're trying to call `tiger.hunt("Deer")`, but the `hunt` method in the anonymous class doesn't exist in the `Animal` class. You need to add the `hunt` method to the `Animal` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```java
public class TestAnimal {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal tiger = new Animal("Tiger") {
            @Override
            public void makeSound() {
                System.out.println("Roar!");
            }

            public void hunt(String prey) {
                System.out.printf("%s likes to hunt %s\n", name, prey);
            }
        };

        tiger.makeSound();
        tiger.hunt("Deer");
    }
}

abstract class Animal {
    String name, color;
    float weight;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void hunt(String string) {
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%s-%s-%.1f", name, color, weight);
    }
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added the missing `makeSound` method in the anonymous class with a default "Roar!" sound.
2. Added the `hunt` method to the anonymous class to match the method call in the `main` method.
