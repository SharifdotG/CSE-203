In Java, when you are implementing a method from an interface, you must use the `@Override` annotation to indicate that you are intentionally overriding a method from an interface or superclass. The correct declaration for the overridden method in the `Playable` interface would be:

a) `public void play()`

So, the correct answer is option "a". This is the standard way to declare a method that implements an interface method. You don't need to use the `abstract` keyword in this context because interface methods are implicitly abstract, and the `public` access modifier is optional for interface methods (it is implied).
