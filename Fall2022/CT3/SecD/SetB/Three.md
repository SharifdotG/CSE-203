If your last name is "Yousuf," here are two overloaded methods with the method name "Yousuf":

```java
public class Yousuf {
    // Overloaded method with different parameter types
    public void Yousuf(int number) { // Main Answer
        // Method implementation
    }

    // Overloaded method with different number of parameters
    public void Yousuf(String text1, String text2) { // Main Answer
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

In this updated example, we have replaced "Smith" with "Yousuf," and the two overloaded methods still have the same concept: one with different parameter types (int) and the other with a different number of parameters (two strings).
