In Java, when you override a method from a superclass in a subclass, the overridden method in the subclass must have the same method signature (method name, return type, and parameter types) as the method in the superclass. 

Given the method signature "void test()" that you provided, let's evaluate the options:

1. `void test()`: This is the same method signature as the one you mentioned, so it's a correct overridden method.

2. `protected void test()`: This is also a valid overridden method because it has the same method name and return type, and it has a less restrictive access modifier (protected is more permissive than the default package-private).

3. `public void test()`: This is also a valid overridden method because it has the same method name and return type, and it has a more permissive access modifier (public is more permissive than the default package-private).

So, all of the options (1, 2, and 3) are correct overridden methods for `void test()`. Therefore, the correct answer is option 4: "All of the above."
