The code you provided has errors on lines 8 and 10 because you are trying to access instance variables and methods that are not defined in the `Employee` class. In Java, when you declare a reference variable of a parent class type (in this case, `Employee`), you can only access members (variables and methods) that are defined in the parent class itself, not in its subclasses. 

Here's what's happening in more detail:

1. Line 8: `emp.hourlyRate = 100;` is trying to set the `hourlyRate` variable for an object of the `Employee` class, which doesn't have a `hourlyRate` variable. `hourlyRate` is defined in the `PartTimeEmployee` subclass, so you can't directly access it using a reference to the `Employee` class.

2. Line 10: `emp.getHourlyRate();` is trying to call the `getHourlyRate()` method on an object of the `Employee` class, which doesn't have a `getHourlyRate()` method. Again, this method is defined in the `PartTimeEmployee` subclass, so it cannot be accessed using an `Employee` reference.

To fix these errors, you need to create an object of the appropriate subclass (`PartTimeEmployee` in this case) and then you can access the subclass-specific members. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```java
package ct;

public class TestEmployee {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PartTimeEmployee emp = new PartTimeEmployee(); // Create a PartTimeEmployee object
        emp.name = "Haider";
        emp.id = "111";
        emp.hourlyRate = 100; // Now you can access hourlyRate
        System.out.println(emp.getSalary());
        System.out.println(emp.getHourlyRate()); // Now you can call getHourlyRate()
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, we create an object of the `PartTimeEmployee` subclass, so we can access its specific members without any errors.
