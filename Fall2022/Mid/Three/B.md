# b. What will be output of the code below? Explain your steps in details.

```java
package mid;
public class TestOutput {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array1 = new int[]{1,3,5,7,9};
        int[] array2 = new int[]{2,3,6,7,5,9};

        int len = array1.length;
        if (array2.length < len)
            len = array2.length;

        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (array1[i] > array2[i])
                result += array1[i];
            else
                result += array2[i];
        }

        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

1. Two arrays are declared and initialized:
   - `array1` contains elements: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
   - `array2` contains elements: [2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 9]

2. The variable `len` is assigned the length of `array1` (which is 5).

3. An `if` statement checks whether the length of `array2` is less than `len`. Since the length of `array2` is 6 and is not less than `len`, the value of `len` is updated to 5.

4. The `result` variable is initialized to 0.

5. A loop runs from 0 to `len - 1` (0 to 4 in this case):

   - In the first iteration (i = 0):
     - `array1[0]` is 1 and `array2[0]` is 2. Since `array2[0]` is greater, `result` becomes 2.

   - In the second iteration (i = 1):
     - `array1[1]` is 3 and `array2[1]` is 3. The elements are equal, so `result` becomes 2 + 3 = 5.

   - For the remaining iterations (i = 2 to 4):
     - `array1[i]` and `array2[i]` are compared, and the greater value is added to `result`.

6. The loop finishes, and `result` becomes 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 27.

7. The `System.out.println` statement prints "Result: 27".

So, the output of the code will be:
```
Result: 27
```
